# Online_Retail_Customer_segmentataion

The "Online Retail Transaction" dataset contains information on transactions made by customers through an online retail platform. The dataset includes data on the products that were purchased, the quantity of each product, the date and time of each transaction, the price of each product, the unique identifier for each customer who made a purchase, and the country where each customer is located. This dataset can be used to analyze customer behavior and preferences, identify popular products, and optimize pricing and marketing strategies. The dataset is well-suited for data analysis and machine learning applications, as it contains a large volume of transactional data that can be used to train predictive models and make data-driven decisions.
